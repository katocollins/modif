      <p>Collins is a student at Makerere University pursuing a<br>
         Bacherlor's of Science in Software Engineering. I look<br>
         forward to applying the explicit knowledge and<br>
         techniques from my lecturers so as to become an<br>
         exceptional Software Developer in the forth<br>
         coming Digital Era. As a student so far, i have gained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
         some programming skills like Web Development and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
         building simple programs which i guess can earn<br>
         me something as for the start. I also have interest<br>
         in leadership and I hope that someday I will stand<br>
         for a post.</p></td>
